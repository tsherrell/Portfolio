# Trent Sherrell's Portfolio

## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my supplemental portfolio. As a product designer, there are deliverables I produce that are not visual. Case in point is the documentation of requirements in a way that facilitate shared understanding and a successful development process.

Within this GitHub repository, I have placed a sample epic and its related user stories into typical views I use for product design and management.

The table, timeline, and board views of the work is available within this [product roadmap project](https://github.com/users/tsherrell/projects/5).

The content of the individual 'tickets' can be viewed via this [list of issues](https://github.com/tsherrell/Portfolio/issues).
_(Accessing content is easier if you have and log in with GitHub credentials.)_

### For context:
I am a product designer with experience building for AI interaction. Passionate about unravelling complexity and turning every challenge into an opportunity for discovery and innovation. With an analytical mind and relentless curiosity, I excel in gathering detailed requirements and translating them into comprehensive user stories, UX artefacts, and product documentation for seamless product development. My dedication ensures that every project is both user-centric and developer-friendly.
